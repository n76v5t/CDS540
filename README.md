java cCDS540 Assignment 1 - Text Detection from Images Using OpenCV
Task objective
The objective of this assignment is to use Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, or any other suitable tool to detect text from images using OpenCV. This will help you understand the concepts of fundamental Computer Vision algorithms and techniques, evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of computer vision systems, and apply and implement these tools and techniques. Task description:
1.Setup Environment:
oUse Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, or any other platform you are comfortable with.
oEnsure that OpenCV and other necessary libraries are installed.
2.Load an Image:
oLoad a sample image containing text. You can use images from various sources like scanned documents, street signs, or any image with clear text.
3.Pre-process the Image:
oConvert the image to grayscale.
oApply necessary image processing techniques like thresholding, blurring, or edge detection to enhance text visibility.
4.Text Detection:
oUse OpenCV's text detection methods such as the EAST text detector, or any other OpenCV-compatible methods.
oDraw bounding boxes around detected text areas.
5.Extract and Display Text:
oUse OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tools like Tesseract to extract text from the detected regions.
oDisplay the extracted text and the annotated image with bounding boxes.
6.Efficiency and Effectiveness Evaluation:
oMeasure the performance of your text detection system.
oDiscuss the efficiency (speed) and effectiveness (accuracy) of your approach.
oSuggest potential improvements.
